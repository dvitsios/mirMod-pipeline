#2 Take care of multiple _valid_ blast hits.
Select the correct(?) one with a more sophisticated way.
e.g. hsa-let-7a-5p maps to 3 loci: hsa-let-7a-1, -2 and -3


#3 write help function, read arguments from console (with default values otherwise)


#4 filter/cross-check blast output: -> [DONE]
keep first 3 top blast output hits and get the first one that complies with the condition: subject_start < subject_query
I should introduce an extra BLAST output 'cleaner' filter in order to choose the 'best' hit among all possible subject miRNAs
that are aligning to my query seqs.
